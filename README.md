This is a simple web scraper that gets stats from a user's letterboxd account.
I wanted to figure out who my most watched actor and director were.
The letterboxd API is closed, so I built a web scraper that circumvents that.

This shows you your top ten: 
actors
directors
writers
cinematographers
genres
themes

as well as histograms on:
runtimes
release years
ratings

it is not optimized very well but i threw it together in an afternoon
